# What is it?
This is driver for keypad. Keypad is USB device which can execute some actions on computer to help user. User can edit actions for buttons in special editor. Keypad used to work via virtual COM port. But it began work via USB so I had to remake driver. Also I decided to upload it on github.

## Plans for future
It was written in C# but in future I'm going to write it in C++. It's working however it's raw. It has a lot of ways to upgrade it (improve code and its production, add some exceptions).
Also I have some ideas for extension of functionality.
For example:
- give user access to write scripts
- make interaction with some other program (for example: OBS studio, discord, etc.)
